# HOLME
> 한양대학교 2023-2 소프트웨어공학/인공지능 및 응용 프로젝트 (SWE / AI & Applications Project in Hanyang Univ. 2023-2)

## Proposal
We propose HOLME, an innovative MATTER-based smart home application. HOLME is designed to offer a unique solution for **migrating smart home configurations**.

HOLME's main objective is to provide **convenience** and **replaceability**. Using our application, residental facilities generate a QR code that can connect IoT devices. By scanning it, users can import their original smart home settings to the new environment. During the connecting process, if a device does not exist in the current environment, HOLME makes the 'best effort' to implement the original configuration using existing other devices. If replacement is not possible, HOLME sends reports —which are generated by chatGPT—to inform the user about the situation.

HOLME supports voice input through NUGU AI speaker. They can activate or deactivate pre-configured routines and control IoT devices. The AI speaker can also send notifications about the routine replacement process.

Reconfiguring smart home settings every time a user moves is be time consuming and inconvenient. HOLME can simplify this process by allowing users to easily import their smart home settings, providing them with seamless and ever-connected smart home environment.

## Future Works
Currently, Holme is limited to residential facilities such as users' homes and accommodations. However, the core concept of Holme—convenient migration of personal settings—can be applied various places.

For those who frequently use shared offices
For those who have personal preferences such as preferred temperature or music when driving a vehicle
For those who frequently use private rooms in study cafes

We believe the possibilities of Holme are limitless. We expect Holme to play a significant role in the smart home market in the near future.
