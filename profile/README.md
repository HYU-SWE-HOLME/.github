# HOLME
> 한양대학교 2023-2 소프트웨어공학/인공지능 및 응용 프로젝트 (SWE / AI & Applications Project in Hanyang Univ. 2023-2)

## Proposal
We propose HOLME, an innovative MATTER-based smart home application. HOLME is designed to offer a unique solution for **migrating smart home configurations**.

HOLME's main objective is to provide convenience and **replaceability**. Using our application, hotels generate a QR code that can connect IoT devices. By scanning it, users can import their original smart home settings to the new environment. During the connecting process, if a device does not exist in the current environment, HOLME makes the 'best effort' to implement the original configuration using existing other devices. If replacement is not possible, HOLME sends reports —which are generated by chatGPT—to inform the user about the situation.

HOLME supports voice input through NUGU AI speaker. They can activate or deactivate pre-configured routines and control IoT devices. The AI speaker can also send notifications about the routine replacement process.

Reconfiguring smart home settings every time a user moves is be time-consuming and inconvenient. HOLME can simplify this process by allowing users to easily import their smart home settings, providing them with seamless and ever connected smart home environment.
