# HOLME
> 한양대학교 2023-2 소프트웨어공학/인공지능및응용 프로젝트 (SWE/AI & Applications Project in Hanyang Univ. 2023-2)

## Proposal
We propose HOLME, an innovative MATTER-based smart home configuration application. HOLME is designed to provide users with unparalleled convenience and adaptability when managing their smart home environments. It offers a unique solution for seamlessly transferring smart home settings to different locations using QR codes, which marks a significant departure from the traditional smart home paradigm.

HOLME's central objectives revolve around convenience and replaceability. Through the integration of the MATTER protocol, we empower users to effortlessly oversee and control their smart homes. This protocol ensures the compatibility of a wide range of IoT devices, offering a seamless user experience.

HOLME operates on a B2B model, making it more versatile. It not only facilitates the migration of settings between different homes but also extends its capabilities to locations such as hotels. This innovation has the potential to significantly broaden the horizons of smart homes, playing a pivotal role in the emerging sharing economy. HOLME aims to be a game-changer, providing users with a dynamic and adaptable smart home experience, anytime and anywhere, while also opening new possibilities for businesses in the ever-evolving smart technology landscape.
